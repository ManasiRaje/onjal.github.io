_13000 ft_: I am addicted to utmost Euphoria!

_11000 ft_: Wheeeeeee!

_7000 ft_: I think I'm going to go home and make myself an omelette after this

_5000 ft_: Whooooooo!

_2500 ft_: Time to open my chute...

_2300 ft_: Huh? That didn't work. Let's try again.

_2000 ft_: Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit!

_1500 ft_: Oh well. Guess I'm going to die. Might as well enjoy the rest of the dive.

_500 ft_: Man, that omelette would have been so good

_20 ft_: Whoa! Look at those people, they look like ants from up here

_10 ft_: Wait a minute, I'm at 10 feet! Those aren't people, they actually ARE ants

_5 ft_: Here we go. Goodbye world!

_0 ft_ : Wait, I'm not dead? Guess I was so caught up in falling, I forgot to hit the ground. Weird.

_0 ft_ : Now, how about that omelette?
