It was judgement day. For weeks the court had heard testimonies from the witnesses for the prosecution, followed by testimonies from the witnesses for the defense. For days the jury had coolly deliberated and hotly debated in their chambers, deciding the fate of the human being society had entrusted them with. A verdict had finally been reached, and the court sat silent, awaiting it.

"Will the defendant please rise?", boomed the judge's voice, and the defendant rose. "This court pronounces you", the judge continued, "Guilty, of all charges! Your car will be towed"
