The nightmare begins. I sweep the crowded room and realize I barely know anyone here. I slap a smile on my face and start strutting around greeting the ones I know. They seem geuninely happy to see me. I am showered with - 'you are glowing!', 'oh what a lovely dress!', 'you should meet us more often'. I try to blush and stealthily retreat into a corner. Why is this tormenting me so much? Just as I am reminding myself, that I enjoy both parties and people, I notice the coffee container on the table I am leaning against. Then it hits me. I am addicted to utmost euphoria.
